## Dataset Description 
 
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

   
- **"ScheduledDay"** tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.

- **"Neighborhood"** indicates the location of the hospital.

- **"Scholarship"**  indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

>**Tip**: Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says **‘No’** if the patient showed up to their appointment, and **‘Yes’** if they did not show up.
